## Definitions

Cancers are a large family of diseases that involve abnormal [cell growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth) with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. They form a subset of [neoplasms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm). A neoplasm or tumor is a group of cells that have undergone unregulated growth and will often form a mass or lump, but may be distributed diffusely.

All tumor cells show the [six hallmarks of cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hallmarks_of_Cancer). These characteristics are required to produce a malignant tumor. They include:

* Cell growth and division absent the proper signals
* Continuous growth and division even given contrary signals
* Avoidance of programmed cell death
* Limitless number of cell divisions
* Promoting blood vessel construction
* Invasion of tissue and formation of metastases

The progression from normal cells to cells that can form a detectable mass to outright cancer involves multiple steps known as malignant progression.

## Causes

The majority of cancers, some **_90–95%_** of cases, are due to genetic mutations from environmental and lifestyle factors. The remaining 5–10% are due to [inherited genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity).

Common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include tobacco (**_25–30%_**), diet and [obesity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity) (**_30–35%_**), infections (**_15–20%_**), [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation) (both ionizing and non-ionizing, up to **_10%_**), stress, lack of [physical activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise) and pollution.

## Prevention

Cancer prevention is defined as active measures to decrease cancer risk. The vast majority of cancer cases are due to environmental risk factors. Many of these environmental factors are controllable lifestyle choices. Thus, cancer is generally preventable. Between **_70%_** and **_90%_** of common cancers are due to environmental factors and therefore potentially preventable.

1. Dietary  
Dietary recommendations for cancer prevention typically include an emphasis on [vegetables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable), [fruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit), [whole grains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_grain) and [fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish) and an avoidance of processed and red meat (beef, pork, lamb), animal fats, pickled foods and [refined carbohydrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate#Nutrition).
2. Medication
3. Vaccination  
Vaccines have been developed that prevent infection by some carcinogenic viruses. Human papillomavirus vaccine (Gardasil and Cervarix) decrease the risk of developing cervical cancer.The hepatitis B vaccine prevents infection with hepatitis B virus and thus decreases the risk of liver cancer. The administration of human papillomavirus and hepatitis B vaccinations is recommended when resources allow.
